# Filter

The task I was given by Harvard CS50 was to create a filter. The purpose of image filtering is to enhance or alter the appearance of an image in a controlled manner. It is commonly used for various applications. Filter refers to the process of applying a transformation to each pixel of an image to achieve a desired visual effect or extract specific features. This involves modifying the pixel values based on the surrounding pixels.
